1. **Final project draft description**

To rejuvenate the world of online dating,considering online dating is trending at an all time high and continues to rise. However, what if your first choice isn&#39;t your best choice? We want to help people find their true soulmate based on their personalities and interests,  not just by a 5 second glance at their &quot;looks&quot; which can often be deceiving.  We want our software to facilitate a more meaningful connection between users instead of a shallow hook-up.

**Feedback Response**

Online dating software such as Tinder and Bumble shifts the user focus to swipe based solely on looks since the user decides to like or dislike based on the other person&#39;s pictures. With this project we are focusing on making users match using other factors not just pictures. Our project consists on making users establish a link via interests initially. The link between interests we are trying to generate it by making users swipe on events or venues first and then give a list of users who are also interested in that event. By clicking on venues such as museums and restaurant,  or events such as concerts and sports events first,  an initial interest is shared and we believe that this would allow for a meaningful connection between users. A considerable contrast between Blind Event and other dating software is that we are limiting the number of likes towards other users so each match is considered valuable and special. An additional feature we would implement is a match probability which we generate  by making users take an initial survey at the time of registration, their responses are stored and introduced to our algorithm which determines a probability based on the similarity with the other user.

**3. Software process**

The software process employed in the project is the plan-driven approach. The project is being broken into separate phases within a predetermined time frame.  Clearly we are spending considerable time in the Requirement and Design phase. Evidence of a Plan-Driven approach is the documentation around the application such as a requirements document, class diagram, sequence diagram , and use case diagram. By following this software process each individual is in charge of a task and each member has a specified delivery date for their task list. Task monitoring using a plan-driven approach is also evident in our project considering that every member  knows exactly what the other member is in charge of.

**4. Software process model**

The software process model employed in the project is the waterfall method since we are following a sequential process in terms of development. To support the usage of the waterfall method we have established a predetermined set of functional and non-functional requirements. Since the Requirements are well understood it is inflexible to go back to change the main focus.

The stages of waterfall are Requirements, System and software design, implementation,  and finally operation and maintenance. For this project we are mainly focusing on the first two stages. By providing enough documentation supporting the Requirements and Design developers would have a better understanding as to what is necessary against desirable and take opportunity costs into consideration without the involvement of the customer, which is characteristic of a waterfall method implementation.

**5. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS**

**5.A) Functional**

User must provide name age gender and email at the time of registration which should be secured in a database.

User must fill the ten questions in the initial survey to continue using the application

User must select a city to browse events, after the user has selected a city the category of events provided for that city should be displayed.

User must be able to choose event category and actual event within the category .

The algorithm will provide a rating based on the initial survey response to serve as a suggestion as to which match might be more similar to each other

User must to be able to view profile of the top 6 matches based on the rating algorithm and select only 3 per day

User must have the option of deleting his or her account which deletes the users data from the database.

User must provide correct and matching login credentials at login phase if application is deleted or user logged out.
